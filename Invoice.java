/*‚¶Å	Create a class called Invoice that a hardware store might
 *  use to represent an invoice for an item sold  at  the  store.
 *    An  Invoice  should  include  four  pieces  of  information  as  
 *    instance variables-a part number(type String),a part description(type String),
 *    a quantity of the item being purchased (type int) and a price per item (double).
 *     Your class should have a constructor that initializes the four instance variables. In addition, provide a method named getInvoiceAmount that calculates the invoice amount.
