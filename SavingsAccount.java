/*‚¶Å	Create class SavingsAccount. Use a static variable annualInterestRate
 *  to store the annual interest rate for all account holders. 
 *  Each object of the class contains a private instance variable savingsBalance
 *   indicating the amount the saver currently has ondeposit. 
 *   Provide method calculateMonthlyInterest to calculate the monthly interest 
 *   by multiplying the savingsBalance by annualInterestRate divided by 12 this interest  
 *   should  be  added  to  savingsBalance.  Provide  a  static  method 
 *   modifyInterestRate that sets the annualInterestRate to a new value.
